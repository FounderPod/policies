# Citizen Code of Conduct

Guiding Values: 
Abundance: Everyone is better off when we share freely. Give first to the community because it’s the right thing to do. Believe it will come back to you. 
Authenticity: Be real. No need to airbrush reality to look better. Create a safe environment for others to be real. Keep sensitive information of other community members confidential. Don’t be a jerk.
Growth: Strive to always grow personally and professionally. Think big. Change the world.
